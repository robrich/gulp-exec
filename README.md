gulp-exec ![status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/robrich/gulp-exec.png?branch=master)
===========

[exec](http://nodejs.org/api/child_process.html#child_process_child_process_exec_command_options_callback) plugin for [gulp](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp)

Usage
-----

```javascript
var exec = require('gulp-exec');

gulp.task('reset', function() {
  var options = {
    continueOnError: false, // default = false, true means don't emit error event
    pipeStdout: false, // default = false, true means stdout is written to file.contents
    customTemplatingThing: "test" // content passed to gutil.template()
    // options.childProcess will be set to ChildProcess object resulting from exec()
  };
  var reportOptions = {
  	err: true, // default = true, false means don't write err
  	stderr: true, // default = true, false means don't write stderr
  	stdout: true // default = true, false means don't write stdout
  }
  return gulp.src('./**/**')
    .pipe(exec('git checkout <%= file.path %> <%= options.customTemplatingThing %>', options))
    .pipe(exec.reporter(reportOptions));
});
```

**Note**: If you just want to run a command, just run the command, don't use this plugin:

```js
var exec = require('child_process').exec;

gulp.task('task', function (cb) {
  exec('ping localhost', function (err, stdout, stderr) {
    console.log(stdout);
    console.log(stderr);
    cb(err);
  });
})
```

~~`gulp.src('.')`~~ does bad things.  Don't do it.

**Note**: running and reporting are now separate, a breaking change from previous versions.
